# Methodology for Valuing Private Sector Speaker and Moderator Time and Travel (OT5 / PSE-4)

## Purpose and Scope

US APEC–RISE values private sector contributions under indicator OT5 (PSE-4) using a standardized approach that ensures consistency, traceability, and alignment with U.S. Department of State guidance. PSE-4 captures “reasonably quantifiable private sector resource commitments attributable to USG engagement.” Speaker and moderator contributions qualify when they represent voluntary in-kind labor or privately financed travel that is reasonably attributable to participation in a US APEC–RISE activity.

This methodology describes: (1) how valuation bands were developed; (2) how speakers are classified; (3) how labor time and travel are valued; and (4) how contributions are documented for OT5 reporting.

## Alignment With PSE-4 Requirements

Per PSE-4 definitions, private sector contributions are eligible when:
- The contributor is a private sector entity;
- The contribution is voluntarily provided;
- The contribution is reasonably attributable to US APEC–RISE engagement;
- The contribution is not recorded as cost-share under another award;
- The contribution exceeds routine duties (i.e., not something they would have done without USG engagement); and
- The contribution is supported by documented evidence.

For workshops embedded within or held alongside broader conferences or convenings, such as the APEC Senior Official Meetings (SOMs), contributions must be attributable specifically to US APEC–RISE sessions and not to the broader event.

## Basis for Valuation: Speaker Sample and Salary Benchmarks

The labor valuation model was developed in two steps.

### Speaker Sample from APEC Workshops

US APEC–RISE reviewed a sample of private sector speakers and moderators engaged in prior APEC workshops. For each individual, staff recorded job titles, seniority, and approximate years of experience. This review provided a realistic picture of the types of private sector professionals typically engaged across APEC economies.

### Salary Benchmarking

Using this profile of typical roles, US APEC–RISE conducted a one-time salary benchmarking exercise using publicly available sources such as LinkedIn Salary Insights, Glassdoor, and PayScale. For each role type, available salary estimates were averaged and converted to hourly rates using an annual salary divided by 2,080 hours.

The combination of the APEC speaker sample and the salary benchmarking exercise was used to define standardized professional categories and their corresponding hourly rates. These rates are applied consistently to all future speakers and remain fixed for the duration of the project.

Only publicly available or voluntarily provided information is used. Individual salary data are never requested.

## Professional Role Categories and Standard Rates

Given that US APEC–RISE primarily engages senior-level private sector experts, the project applies two standardized professional categories reflecting typical experience and leadership levels.

**Executive / Senior Leadership**  
Typically 15 or more years of experience, with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Common titles include President, CEO, COO, Vice President, Country Director, Regional Director, Managing Director, General Manager, Partner or Senior Partner, and Department Head.

**Senior Specialist**  
Typically 10 to 15 years of experience, with a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree. Common titles include Senior Advisor, Senior Economist, Senior Consultant, Senior Manager, and Senior Trade Specialist.

Based on the benchmarking exercise, US APEC–RISE applies the following standardized hourly rates:
- Executive / Senior Leadership: USD 149 per hour  
- Senior Specialist: USD 131 per hour  

---

## Assigning Speakers to Categories

For each speaker or moderator, staff review background information voluntarily shared by the individual, such as a LinkedIn profile, CV, or speaker biography. The review focuses on job titles and seniority, employment history and years of experience, and degrees or professional certifications.

This review is conducted manually, with no scraping or automated extraction, in accordance with LinkedIn platform terms of use.

A semi-automated tool may be used to assist staff by evaluating pasted text for experience and seniority cues and suggesting a category. Final category assignment remains a staff determination. Any override or adjustment is documented with rationale to support auditability.

## Workshop Types and Travel Context

Valuation depends on how and why the speaker participated.

### Stand-Alone US APEC–RISE Workshops

When a speaker travels specifically and solely for a US APEC–RISE workshop, all eligible preparation, delivery, and follow-up time may be valued. Privately funded travel costs that are necessary and incremental to participation, such as airfare, lodging, and M&IE, may also be valued provided they are not reimbursed by another source.

### Multi-Session Contributions Within a Single Workshop

When a speaker contributes to more than one session within the same workshop, session durations are recorded separately. Total presentation hours equal the sum of all session hours, and preparation and follow-up time scale with total presentation time.

### Multi-Workshop Trips

When a speaker participates in more than one US APEC–RISE workshop on the same trip, privately funded travel is counted only once and allocated evenly across workshops by dividing total travel cost by the number of US APEC–RISE workshops attended.

---

## Labor Time Valuation

Presentation hours are defined as the total time the speaker or moderator spends presenting or moderating in a given workshop, summed across all sessions.

To ensure consistent and conservative valuation, US APEC–RISE applies a standardized ratio of preparation and follow-up time to presentation time. Preparation time is valued at two times presentation hours, and follow-up time is valued at one-half of presentation hours. Total labor hours therefore equal three and one-half times presentation hours.

Labor contribution is calculated by multiplying total labor hours by the standardized hourly rate assigned to the speaker’s professional category.

---

## Travel Cost Estimation

To ensure consistency across workshops and economies, US APEC–RISE applies standardized travel assumptions.

Airfare is estimated using Kayak or equivalent flight search tools, based on a round-trip economy-class fare from the speaker’s home economy to the workshop location using the lowest reasonable fare for approximate workshop dates.

Lodging and M&IE rates are based on U.S. Department of State foreign per diem rates for the workshop location. Lodging is valued at 100 percent of the posted lodging rate per night. M&IE is valued at 75 percent of the posted rate on travel days and 100 percent of the posted rate on full days in location.

Regardless of distance or flight duration, US APEC–RISE assumes two travel days per trip, one outbound and one return. Travel days are used solely to standardize the calculation of lodging nights and M&IE allowances. Time spent in transit is not valued as labor under this methodology, regardless of whether the individual works while traveling.

---

## Travel Duration Calculation

Travel duration is used only for calculating lodging nights and per diem days. Eligible days equal the end date minus the start date plus one. Lodging nights equal eligible days minus one.

---

## Ineligible Travel

Travel is not valued when it is paid or reimbursed by US APEC–RISE, paid or reimbursed by another donor or third party, primarily for unrelated business or personal purposes, or travel that would have occurred regardless of the US APEC–RISE session, such as general conference attendance with no incremental cost.

---

## Total OT5 Valuation per Workshop

For each workshop in which a private sector speaker or moderator participates, the total OT5 contribution equals the labor contribution plus any allocated travel contribution. Travel is included only when it is privately funded and eligible under this methodology.

---

## Documentation Requirements

Each OT5 entry must be supported by sufficient documentation to verify the valuation. Required documentation includes the workshop agenda confirming session participation and duration; a LinkedIn profile, CV, or speaker biography supporting category assignment; category assignment notes documenting rationale; the salary benchmarking analysis used to establish standardized rates; travel documentation such as airfare estimates and foreign per diem rate sources; and the Airtable “OT5 Private Sector Resources” table, which serves as the centralized system of record.

---

## Data Quality and Reporting

To maintain data quality, all OT5 entries are entered by the M&E Lead, validated quarterly, stored in Airtable in a structured format, and aggregated for quarterly and annual monitoring and evaluation reporting.

This methodology aligns with OPUDATA, 18 FAM 301, and PSE-4 guidance, ensuring that valuations are accurate, consistent, conservative, and verifiable.
