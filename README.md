# US APEC–RISE OT5 Private Sector Valuation Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the **OT5 / PSE-4 Private Sector Valuation Tool** developed for the **US APEC–RISE** program.  
The tool implements a **standardized, transparent, and auditable methodology** for valuing private sector speaker and moderator contributions that are reasonably attributable to US APEC–RISE activities.

The methodology and calculations implemented here support reporting under **OT5 (PSE-4)**, which captures:

> *“Reasonably quantifiable private sector resource commitments attributable to USG engagement.”*

This tool is intended for **internal program use** and supports consistent valuation across workshops, economies, and reporting periods.

## Purpose and Rationale

US APEC–RISE engages private sector experts as speakers and moderators across a range of technical workshops. These contributions often represent **voluntary in-kind labor** and **privately funded travel** that would not have occurred absent USG engagement.

This tool was developed to:

- Ensure **consistent valuation** of private sector contributions
- Apply **fixed, standardized assumptions** across all workshops
- Maintain **traceability and audit readiness** for OT5 reporting
- Align with U.S. Department of State guidance, including OPUDATA and 18 FAM 301
- Preserve **human judgment** where policy requires manual review

The tool intentionally avoids automated data scraping, individual salary collection, or dynamic recalculation of historical values.

## What the Tool Does

The Streamlit application in this repository:

- Collects standardized inputs related to:
  - Speaker professional category
  - Presentation hours
  - Travel eligibility and duration
- Applies fixed labor and travel valuation formulas
- Separates **labor contributions** and **travel contributions**
- Calculates a **total OT5 value per workshop**
- Supports documentation and justification for each valuation
- Produces values that are entered into Airtable as the system of record

The tool calculates values **once per entry** and does not retroactively update or revalue historical contributions.

## Valuation Methodology (Summary)

### Professional Categories and Hourly Rates

Private sector speakers and moderators are assigned to one of two standardized professional categories:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Executive / Senior Leadership | Senior executives and leaders with 15+ years of experience |
| Senior Specialist | Senior technical experts with approximately 10–15 years of experience |

Hourly rates for each category were established through a one-time salary benchmarking exercise using publicly available sources and are **fixed for the duration of the project**.

---

### Labor Valuation

Labor time includes:
- Presentation time
- Standardized preparation time
- Standardized follow-up time

To ensure consistency and avoid over- or under-estimation, total labor hours are calculated using a fixed multiplier:

Total Labor Hours = 3.5 × Presentation Hours

Labor contribution is calculated as:

Labor Contribution (USD) = Hourly Rate × Total Labor Hours


This ratio is applied uniformly across all workshops and speakers.

---

### Travel Valuation

When travel is **privately funded** and **incremental to participation in a US APEC–RISE activity**, travel costs may be valued.

Travel valuation includes:
- Estimated round-trip economy airfare
- Lodging based on U.S. Department of State foreign per diem rates
- M&IE based on U.S. Department of State foreign per diem rates

Standardized assumptions include:
- Two travel days per trip (outbound and return)
- 75% of M&IE on travel days
- 100% of M&IE on full days in location
- Travel time itself is **not valued as labor**

For multi-workshop trips, travel costs are allocated evenly across workshops to prevent double counting.

---

## What the Tool Does *Not* Do

This tool intentionally does **not**:

- Scrape LinkedIn or other external platforms
- Collect or store individual salary data
- Automatically assign professional categories without staff review
- Recalculate or update historical OT5 values
- Value time spent in transit as labor

These design choices support conservative valuation, compliance with platform terms of use, and audit defensibility.

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   streamlit run app.py





   Data Storage and Reporting

Final OT5 values generated by this tool are entered into the Airtable “OT5 Private Sector Resources” table, which serves as the authoritative system of record.

Aggregated OT5 values are used for:

Quarterly performance reporting

Annual reporting

Internal monitoring and evaluation

Governance and Change Management

All valuation assumptions are fixed for the duration of the project

Any changes to rates, formulas, or categories must be documented and approved

The repository serves as the authoritative reference for OT5 valuation logic

Historical valuations are not recalculated once recorded

Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

US APEC–RISE Monitoring & Evaluation staff

Program management and reporting teams

Internal reviewers and auditors

It is not intended for public use or external submission without appropriate context.
